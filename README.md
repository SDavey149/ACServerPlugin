##Assetto Corsa UDP Plugin

An alternative to the current UDP service provided by Assetto Corsa as the current built in method is limited a lot by the data it transmits and the documentation is not updated. This plugin is another way of setting up a UDP
server but with far less restrictions on the data you can fetch as you can gather data from the Python API and through the shared memory interface. 

*No releases yet, still in development.*
